HTTP:    
    HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol and is used for client-server communication. An user can send requests to a server and a server can send responses to a client using HTTP. Here we will see the difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2

HTTP1.1:
    * HTTP1.1 was created in 1997.
    * All request and responses are in plain text format.
    * HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
    * It compresses data by itself.
    * Multiplexing is not possible.
    * HTTP1.1 is slower than HTTP2
    * Server push is not possible in HTTP1.1

HTTP2:
    * HTTP2 was created in 2015.
    * All request and responses are in binary format.
    * HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
    * It compresses data by HPACK.
    * Multiplexing is possible.
    * HTTP2 is faster than HTTP1.1
    * HTTP2 allows server to push content to a client before the client asks for it (Server push).
